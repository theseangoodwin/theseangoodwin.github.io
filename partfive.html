    <h2>56. Contortionist</h2>
    <p>What is this pit in my stomach? This mixing air and space? It’s incapacitating anxiety building on top of something. It swells to infect my lungs and leaves them gasping for air. My chest is tight and reluctant to lift. When I lie in bed at night, my breathing is short and my head is twisting into some complicated shape I can’t define. My body has corners that come together to make impossible intersections. Their existence cannot exist outside of imagination.</p>
    <p>I am changing, perhaps faster than I can take and faster than I can understand. Here, then there, I am made from pieces coming from all sides bound to a central point. It’s complicated and out of my control. What do I do with knowledge that can’t be de ned? What is to be said about new and indescribable existence? Although I see the contortion, I am confused; distracted, rather, by the arms and legs spewing from the thick knot.</p>

    <h2>58. Expressionist</h2>
    <p>“Great. I have some questions below so you have some food for thought. I’ll follow up in March and see if that would be a good time for you to provide responses or if you’d like to wait a bit. Also, if you have a headshot and/or any pictures of the uni- versity and your study abroad experience, we would love to include those as well. Thank you very much for your help with this. I’ll be sure to let you know when the article is published.</p>
<p>Please tell me all about your study abroad trip. I want to know what you studying/what classes are you taking and how does this apply to your major? Why did you choose Kedge in Marseille, France? How long will you be there?”</p>
<p>Courses: Organizational Behavior, Principles of Marketing, Sustainable Development, Management Information Systems </p>
<p>KEDGE Business School is within the top 10 circle for the <strong>Grand Ecole</strong> system in France. It is a well-respected college on an international level and has a local reputation of being reserved for the best in the city. Marseille itself is the second largest city in France. The Vieux Port was among the first in the world to link intercontinental trade and has been the business hub of the continent and much of the world for 26 centuries. Its location is the access point across the Mediterranean Sea to trade in North Africa and the Middle East. Both of these areas and their many cultures are represented here. While the strict French typecast is present, there is a much broader level of international diversity in the streets, businesses, and the KEDGE campus. It’s similar to GMU in a lot of ways and I do feel that the diversity in our school has prepared me for international life like this.</p>
<p>“Which study abroad programs did you look at and why did you choose the one you did?”</p>
<p>There weren’t many options for me. I’ve studied French for 4 years and am committed to putting French fluency on my resume. This commitment lead me to KEDGE. It’s a direct exchange program which makes the application and credit transfer very simple. I told myself that if I was going to learn a language, I was going to learn it from its source, and this city and the people have been very helpful in getting me to that point. I’ve developed familiarity with the language much more than I’ve been able to in the classroom.</p>
<p>“What are you looking forward to most during this experience? What do you anticipate being your key takeaway from this trip- personally and to apply to the business world?”</p>
<p>This trip has presented me with many great opportunities. The one I look forward to most is celebrating Easter at St. Peter’s Square with Pope Francis. In only two months, however, I’ve been able to do some incredible things. I’ve toured South France, skied the Alps, learned French from native speakers, rented my first apartment, thrived in global diversity, developed my career, and made connections that will last long after I touch back down at Dulles. A concise list is no longer possible to make because my time abroad has developed nearly every part of my personality. I set out with the goal to consolidate the traits of my role model. I’ve done that and more because Rockefeller’s resourcefulness and versatility are here to stay.</p>
<p>“Any advice for students considering studying abroad at Mason?”</p>
<p>Studying abroad is a commitment that anyone who is considering the idea surely realizes. My advice before making any serious decision is to make sure that the product sits well with your head and your heart. If the three don’t make sense together, you’ll eventually reach a point where you question your decision. Questioning leads to doubt and doubt leads to regret. The last thing you want to do is regret being alone on a flight out of the country for half a year.</p>
<p>There has to be purpose for you to study abroad, whether it’s for credits toward your degree or for the language. Logically justify why you want to do it and what it will do for you. Secondly, make sure you’re emotionally invested in the challenge. Love the idea of what the time away will do to you, set goals to keep yourself on track, and be prepared to be uncomfortable nearly every day while you’re away. Know that things will go wrong and you will miss whatever you’ve left back home.</p>
<p>“What does it mean to you to be awarded the Gilman Scholarship? Can you tell me a bit about the application process for you?”</p>
<p>It means a great deal to have been given the Gilman Scholarship. I’ve taken a piece from the last paragraph of one of my application essays. I spoke honestly when I said:</p>
<p>“I will proudly carry the name of Mr. Gilman. Receiving his scholarship would alleviate the costs of the exchange, but more than that, it would reaffirm solidarity within myself... The ever-prevalent idea that we are the ultimate determinants of our own happiness is nothing without the participation of others...”</p>
<p>The Gilman International Scholarship sees what I am doing. They’ve read my intentions as I carefully poured my heart into their essay windows and stand behind my endeavors. This support is irreplaceable. This is something that I wish more people could understand. No matter how much I want to be independent and for success to come by my own hand, we will be able to achieve more, faster, when we learn to be interdependent.</p>
<p>By looking to Gilman for help, I was required to be vulnerable and to put myself on the line. It cost me time-a lot of it. I spent at least an hour a day for the better part of the summer months writing the essays, hunting for the most concise way to speak about the depth of my past, and the goals I have for the future.</p>
<p>“What has been your favorite experience while studying abroad thus far?” I’ve recently returned from London with some students at KEDGE. The Commission des Opérations Boursières et Financiers (COBFI) is one of the school’s business organizations. It has just paired with the London School of Economics (LSE) and got our group a spot in a lecture with some professors from the University. Professor Alan Manning and Nicola Smith lead a discussion afterwards that gave me insight to the differences between the US minimum wage and the UK wage. It’s been interesting to see the differences between cultures in the most basic parts of society. These are the things I have never thought of any differently and frankly didn’t think any other way existed.</p>
<p>The day after the lecture at LSE we toured London, I had some time with a few friends I met in Barcelona, and the evening was spent in the Bloomberg Financial Analysis offices. I’m not a math person. I barely got out of Hylton’s accounting class and yet I really enjoyed my time with the company. While the majority of the evening was spent talking numbers and working in the Bloomberg Terminal, I was able to break away from the group and sit down at the workspace with one of the company’s marketing project managers. She and I spoke about her daily schedule, opportunities within the company, and also about my potential involvement. In this meeting I got well-needed perspective and am tempted to write about how this experience is going to change my career concretely.</p>
<p>The truth is that I don’t know exactly what is to come for me. This semester has made me fully under- stand that. I work hard and get involved with those things I think are admirable, but truthfully I only have intuition to go off of. What I do know now is that I’m on the cusp of some big opportunities, the likes of which I didn’t think would come so soon. My goals grow very fast and I’m told, “go big or go home, right?” I’ve decided I don’t want to go home.</p>

    <h2>59. I Am Scared I’ll Do the Things I Think About</h2>
    <p>The more I think about falling into the water at Vieux Port, the more I tell myself not to. But the more I tell myself not to, the closer I get to falling. The more I imagine jumping from the lookout above the city, the more scared I become. I am scared of myself and what I am capable of doing. Good or bad, there is an intense dichotomy to achievement. I step up to the ledge of my balcony and look below. What if I one day choose to let myself go?</p>

    <h2>60. A Reflection on Mechanisms and Their Relationship to Falling Dust</h2>
    <p>Metallic buzz, cold reverb, still air, and nothingness. There’s blank space between my eyes and the shivering stones in the Gothic church. I sit and stare blankly, noticing the momentary speckles of falling dust. They glisten. I’m at peace until a strange man steps into the sanctuary. He’s dressed all in black but is not a priest. He looks tiny because the ceiling hangs and looms ominously above his dusty brown head. His soft-heeled shoes make more sound than they should in this quiet place. It’s early evening. The tranquil specks drift through the stained light that gleam in the fading sun. Heel, toe, heel, toe, with purpose and pattern, his steps break the air. My neck turns so my eyes can follow him. He reaches the center of the marble altar, clicks his ankles together, and bends at the waist in a way that makes me think that he cracked his spine in a few places. He straightens his back, puts his hands down to his side, and continues on his way. He steps diagonally up onto the altar and then to the lectern.</p>
    <p>I’ve finally found the buzzing sound. It is the anxiety that sparsely fills the void from the top of the high-backed pews to the ceiling. The man touches the little microphone once and it reacts to him three times. The sound of his finger echoes down the aisle. The wiring whines as it is probed to stand taller and to nearly touch the man’s lips. He steps away and leaves its space. He moves back, following his old footsteps exactly. I follow him across the altar and watch as he leaves the room.</p>
    <p>I look back to the lectern. The buzzing grows, cycling through the microphone and speakers, starting at a mumble and then turning into a pitched hum. It is a subtle call for help that sounds hastily. It swells until it loses its innocent tickle. The mouth widens and the chords rub against one another. Some treacherous being has come from the dark crypts below. Its cold stone teeth and stained glass eyes widen with ferocity. It rises through the floor and violently erupts with ash and dust. The screams from the damsel fill the room and multiply on their way back and forth between the walls. The bitter particles flood the  space and collapse over the soundwaves.</p>
    <p>Her echoes are abruptly suppressed and silence takes back over. The once prismatic windows are now shattered. The man in black comes back. She quietly begs for his help. Kneeling before him and wrapping her hand around the back of his leg, she gently touches his chin. He is not moved. Removing her arm from his body and circling around, he covers her mouth and pulls her back into the slow-moving, billowy ash.</p>
    <p>The dust settles, there’s a low hum, and cold reverb pass back through the room.</p>

    <h3>11:50<br>14.3.15<br>Arena of Nîmes</h3>
    <h2>61. To the Arcades For My Burial</h2>
    <p>In the top tier of the coliseum, I lay out under the sun. For the first time in a long time, I can feel the heat from the sun directly without the shivery, oceanic winds interrupting. My arm is bent to use my hand as a pillow between the wide stone slab and the back of my head. I twist my neck to look down into the sand pit below.</p>
    <p>Sand is used to cover the middle of the Roman arenas so that when it is mixed, it will cover the smell of blood. The dignitaries, the cheerers, the politicians, and the other onlookers bet on the few fighters that play to kill in the game of glory, but can not stomach the consequences. I think about dying; more specifically, martyrdom. The sand in the center absorbs the blood of both the hunted animals and the criminals. This is a place that you enter knowing that you may not leave. Your life is gambled for either the fame or the demise of your name.</p>
    <p>I think to my future time in Rome itself, and then the Vatican. Am I walking into a coliseum with a square center? I reflect on the publicized threat of terrorism and of my own death. I see it happen. I watch myself die several times, in several ways. A lion enters through the gates and men prod it to step out into the light of the arena. I see the death of children and visualize myself  fighting for the lives of the others around me. I am ultimately bloodied and captured beneath the feet of opposition. I see smoke and tears, grimacing faces, and white light turning red. I feel the pain of laceration, torture, and morbid dehumanization.</p>
    <p>There is new life in Christ, but through physical death. Only death motivates those who oppose the Church. Masses file into the ring and wait for the game to start. It begins with some shadowy beast pouncing out of the shadows. There is an explosion of dust and my vision fails. We can see outlines but cannot clarify bodies because these nouveau- Romans brought tear gas. There is jeering and booing until the first blood is shed; then come the wails of death. Tooth and nail first pierces the skin of those who are chained by fear. They are bound to the pillars by which they stand. They die before the rest while others try to get away. Father puts up a fight. Mother covers her babies as her back is torn to shreds. Blood and spine separate and red splatters in our eyes. Children watch as their mothers are disassembled and color soles like water-based paints. These stains won’t be cleaned. The son’s tears don’t last forever because his brain doesn’t work anymore. Father failed. The beast moves and multiplies, pulling apart from itself. Family, single, couple, layperson, teacher, or priest; different yet all the same to the only eyes that matter in St. Peter’s Square.</p>
    <p>Their name snakes with hate, ISIS, and is praised across the border. All hail and celebrate this authority dethroned in such style and irony. I see the red and then the black. I don’t know what the depth of my choice is hiding as I begin to realize the severity of the coming weeks. Courage is the scale of martyrdom. None of them entered into the coliseum knowing that they would leave. That’s not how the Word works.</p>
    <p>The turmoil of our lives must be faced with faith and conviction. Without this understanding, we are invertebrates too passive to fight. I will fight for the life that I want. I ask myself, “Am I willing to leave those people back home?” “Am I ready to be vulnerable for the sake of my convictions?” Lord knows that I can’t say, and I surely can’t write it down. I do know that I head to the Valley and that this Easter may end my life.</p>
    <p>—</p>
    <p>I will be there. With all that I have, with what I do not, with all of my gifts and talents, with my love and devotion, with my thoughts, and with my brothers and my mother in mind. I will go because it is my passion. Suddenly, these writings have purpose. These words make sense and my body is filled with reason and value that is tangible beyond my understanding. I am more than gold in city streets or water in the desert. I am more than failing flesh and rotting bone. What I do has value. God, that hasn’t been easy to say for the last 20 years. I would never deny it but I could never believe it. It is still hard to accept love, but right now love means something real. This value has weight, matter, scale, and presence because You have shown it to me over these past months. This love swells my insides until I can no longer ignore it. My heart sways heavily and my back bends from the burden. There is new balance. It keeps my chest down and my lungs tight. I move to the altar and breathe to my capacity.</p>
    <p>He is my company when I have none. He is my confidence. I must become better for the sake of my world. I tremble at the thought. I have to survive in second light. In death, there is new life. That is what You tell me and what You give me. You tell me that when I die, my life will be worth more than the business I do, the money I make, and the life I lead. If I change one heart, it will be worth it. I dwell on home and love. My friends and family: Mom, Matthew, Daniel, Ian, Hunter, Doe, Kez, Snek, Clem, and Kalna. I think of K, Marijka, Kalia, and Mace, Patty, Iz, and Emmie. I think of the ones I’ve let into my life. I am thankful for the ones given to me to share my time with. The times we’ve had together are worth any struggle. The time we have shared is valuable because the scale of eternity tilts with the weight of beloved memory.</p>
    <p>What kills me is that now is too perfect of a time to die. I love how You complete me even though I am now broken. I love the way You give my life purpose. These random pieces are connected through one vein. Your blood runs through every part of me when I am completely convicted. I need to be ready and to not allow nervousness to overwhelm me. You’ve shown me what trust looks like in the past three months. You’ve shown me interdependence. You’ve shown me what the product of our union is through the work of my own hands. You’ve shown me that what I called “imperfection” can be made perfect. You’ve shown me loss and desolation. You have never failed to show me the view from the highest mountain. You’ve shown me the work of Your hands, and I try to give you the work of mine. I follow Your fingers and the center of Your palm. I follow Your footsteps as You lead me. I did not travel alone for a single moment. I shiver in the warmth I never thought I could get. I question my reality because it is created and planned by someone else. Life is beautiful beyond understanding. My choices and feelings that I call my own are not just mine.</p>

    <h3>—:—<br>St. Baudile, Nîmes<br>John 3:14-21</h3>
    <h2>63. 4th Sunday of Lent: The Wilderness</h2>
    <p>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.</p>

    <h2>65. Our Mouths are Machines That Bring Imagination to Life</h2>
    <p>I told K. I didn’t expect to and didn’t want to tell anyone. It’s not theirs to worry about. She called with explicitly no purpose, with nothing to say other than ‘hello.’ The thought came to my mind and I held it in, but I wanted so badly to let it go. I don’t want to hold this in because it’s not easy to cope by myself. While Easter threatens my life, life itself is not mine to hold onto. She told me that through her actions. I am not in control and she changed me. She changes me into something shaky and uncomposed. I don’t want to talk about myself when I listen to her. I know my voice. I want to understand hers. I try harder to be better because of her.</p>
    <p>I told her about my death, and about the things I never want to tell anyone. It’s difficult to trust people and with her I hand over control so easily.</p>
