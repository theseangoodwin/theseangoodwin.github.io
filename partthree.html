    <h3>17:32<br>12.1.15<br>Runway to France</h3>
    <h2>2. Lufthansa Flight LH0089</h2>
    <p>I am writing about the nervous thoughts in my head. Here I go. No. here we go. After my departure was delayed a week due to visa complications, I finally have the time to refocus and muster my attention. I am never alone but sometimes I forget that. My desires for a better life push me to do the best that I can in the present moment. When I fail, I tear myself apart believing that I’ve sacrificed some unknown addition to the future. I have been asked to become more dependent; to piece myself together from my innately flawed humanity. I try.</p>
    <section><p class="speedkern">I pray for humility, for honesty, and for a particular openness to vulnerability: to acknowledge the past and to be present for the future. You and I are closer than I’ve ever felt before now that I’m losing all senses of familiarity. I tread lightly into the water and try to imagine emerging on top on the other side. You and I: Communion.</p></section>
    <p class="right">A year and a half, 550 days in a row, have come and gone and not one of them left without a thought of Marseille. My school, jobs, friendships, meetings, and focus all combine together in this moment. Right here, right now. I’ve worked hard to get myself into this seat. Now is not the time to let my nerves get the best of me. I am not scared, but I do question whether this is too good to be true. I am skeptical. I am jaded. I write to leave my baggage on the tarmac. I write to pick up my few belongings and to continue to push the boundaries of character.</p>

      <h3>--:--<br>12.1.15<br>On the Plane</h3>
      <h2>3. The Handmade Jewel</h2>
      <p>A few days before my departure, I was showing my mother the basilica in Marseille. She taught me about Catholic relics, which sent me on a seemingly elusive quest for a piece of history. It wasn’t long before history made its way to me.</p>
      <p>At this altitude, we are all a little bit closer to heaven. The ones we love and miss are only just outside of this metal tube miraculously soaring through the sky. The stewardess sees me moving my fingers through the rosary hanging around my neck, just like my mother always does before flying. She interrupts and we begin an intermittent 6-hour conversation, the kind that is built bit by bit as she walks around the plane. She spends slightly more time pouring drinks and joking with me than attending to the rest of the people on the plane.</p>
      <p>I notice something very admirable about her. <span class="imglink"><img width="500px" src="./images/parttwo_1.jpg"><a>It’s her voice</a></span>. The way she relates to the different passengers, such as the German families returning to Frankfurt from vacation, or the businessmen heading abroad for work, is not limited by language. She knows how to relate to each individual and builds rapport that seems effortless, for both her and for whomever she converses with. It’s as if she doesn’t think about it. She laughs with everyone and presents herself in a way that makes it easy to react, even at 4:00.</p>
      <p>The plane is dark for the final hour of the flight. The plane’s passengers are beginning to arise. The stewardess quickly approaches me from behind and pushes my shoulder from the armrest. “A present for you,” she says, and places a small something in my possession. She makes no eye contact with me, although I was looking for it. She continues down the dim aisle toward the front of the plane, walks past a set of dark blue curtains, and tightly draws them after passing. I am distracted by a sense of secrecy and abnormality about her. In my palm, I find a small circular box that somehow also has corners. I want to use my light to see more clearly, but also don’t want to draw attention to the stewardess if she was in fact trying to be quiet about her present. I pull off the lid, as if it would help me see through the darkness of the cabin. I only see darkness, but the smell that comes from the inside of the box is one of my childhood. It is a spice and sweetness that collects in your throat and lingers there for a while before your body accepts its warmth as something wholly comforting. It is as familiar as walking into an old church parish. It is sharp, striking, but ultimately beautiful, just like the rose petal rosary that lies in the box.</p>
      <p>My mind reflects back to the final hours of my Grandmother’s life. I see her in a bed surrounded by her disunified family. She’s covered in a pale blue loose-knit blanket made by her children, the kind that doesn’t protect you from the cold. I look at my young self sitting hunched over on a bench in the corner of the hospital room. I watch myself look at anything but the bed in the middle of the space and am grateful that I can’t see past the small crowd of people surrounding her.</p>
      <p>I didn’t see it happen. It doesn’t matter where I am, because even if I had the opportunity to see, I wouldn’t have been able to watch her die. My eyes close tightly. My tears swim. The day she died was close to the day I turned thirteen. I didn’t know how to handle the selfish side of me that just wanted a normal birthday. I was too young, too egocentric. I had never dealt with anything like this before, and the ideas I previously held of life and death never focused much on death.</p>
      <div class="circle"></div>
      <p>My innocence and my unfailing optimism left on that day and followed her. I cling to this unfortunate fact as if it is some sort of celestial proof that she and I had a relationship that was unlike those I had with rest of my family. As if it were an alibi justifying my absence from her side. It provided some meager consolation to the inadequate boy who wasn’t strong enough to hold back the tears from his eyes. I wish that I said goodbye. I wish I was strong enough to look at her and tell her that I loved her. I was the only one not there. Self-pity, loss, and change: the three threats that convinced my adolescent mind to hide high up in the clouds.</p>
      <p>Back in the sky, I decided to use the light above my head to dimly illuminate the contents of the box. The beads are a pale painted red and worn. The wood’s grain, however, is not hidden beneath the paint. These beads coil around a thick metal cross depicting a shepherd carrying a sheep over his shoulders. The smell fills the cabin and I start to notice my neighbors reacting to it. I close the lid and conceal the box in my hands. It is a beautiful gift–a birthday present. I feel safe. I feel cared for.</p>
      <p>My spine shivers from these feelings I’ve never felt before. I write to articulate to myself how I feel. I feel here and now the undeniable existence of heaven and its relevance to our lives. I know that my Grandmother is well, because the poignant scent of the rosary is the loving kiss she gave me before sending me off alone.</p>
      <p>The stewardess emerged back through the curtains, looked in my eyes, and placed on my fold-down dinner table a documented relic, a piece of John Paul II’s robe. She walks away and that is the last I see of her.</p>
      <p>Her name is Edna.</p>

      <p>What is the significance of time if left undefined by color or by clockwork? If the shades are pulled down and the sun is gone, how do we measure the speed of our travel? Time is both relative and strikingly universal. It is simultaneously passing and permanent. If it relies on location, then crossing so many lines at once should be a paradox. Where does time end? I want to know so I can get back the 6 hours that were taken from me on this plane.</p>
      <p>“We have twenty five minutes until we land,” I hear the stewardess speak into the overhead. I listen for directions to my transfer, put my pen down, and start to organize my things.</p>

      <h3>12:43<br>13.1.15<br>Campus Luminy</h3>
      <h2>6. First Impressions</h2>
      <p>After making several disjointed inquiries about transportation, I finally arrive on campus. I realize that when I say, “I arrive on campus,” it sounds like I know what I’m doing and where I’m heading now that I’ve come. This is just not true. American colleges and French colleges are very different. America is different than France. As I write this wide-eyed at one in the morning I am far more uncertain about the number of colleges that are on this plot of land. From what I remember, Aix-Marseille, Kedge, EuroMed, and Universite de Luminy all have their names on the front of their buildings.</p>
      <p>While I have nevertheless arrived, I am not in great shape to merely make my apartment contract appointment, let alone my classes. I have with me my duffle bag with wheels (more than 30 pounds), my carry-on bag with my documentation and electronics (more than 15 pounds), and a profoundly abstract campus city map (useless). So, I wander.</p>
      <p>Initially, I followed the student group that got off the bus, but I soon realized that there are many different schools on this campus. Maybe a quarter of those on the bus were attending Kedge Business School with me. I did not follow them since a vast majority of the bus travelers went in the opposite direction.</p>
      <p>For a while, I slowly wandered in intense internal conversation. I was frustrated that I couldn’t interpret the signs or confidently ask for directions. I swallowed my pride and decided to talk to the first uniformed or suited person I could find. Since there were a number of individuals wearing an array of incredibly misleading blazers, I decided to only ask a person for help that looked older than 35, was wearing a suit, and, for added legitimacy, was holding a briefcase.</p>
      <p>Oddly enough, the first person I found was a security guard for Les Calanques Nature Park at the edge of campus. I read about this place before I left for France and had no idea it would be so close to where I would be going to school. I told him that I was looking for the address written on a piece of paper that I pulled out from my carry-on bag. Unfortunately, he didn’t recognize the address and really didn’t speak English. I surely will not say that I speak French even after 4 years of high school education.</p>
      <p id="rose">Our conversation quickly transformed into a retrospectively hilarious dance about ourselves. We talked about where I came from, the time of my arrival, and laughed together. I think at one point he said that he flew airplanes. He stretched out his arms, pointed his fingers, and tilted his body as if that had something to do with flying. We walked down the hill for a while as he tried to find someone for me to speak English with. This lead me to my introduction to Martine.</p>

      <h2>7. The Irony Of It All</h2>
      <p>Martine speaks English. This is good. She also owns a food truck. This is very good. After we are introduced, the park official explains my situation. She hops out of the back of her truck, yells at the man behind the grill, her husband, in beautiful French, and agrees to help. I thank my new friend the park official, and continue down the hill with Martine.</p>
      <p>She is a friendly woman, very likeable and spunky. Physically, she has a medium height and short black hair, with blonde dyed sections. Her eyes command attention so much so that her large, bright red, square frame glasses do not hinder her them. We chat as best as we can. I, again, talk about where I came from, but this time I fill in the gaping holes of my French with English substitutes. I got a big reaction from her when I told her I arrived in the city only hours ago. We get to the gate of the apartment complex, which is locked thanks to the French lunch hour (later, I discovered that “hour” really means “two hours.”) There is no office here that bites the bullet and ‘works through lunch.’ The French are committed to food and I appreciate that.</p>
      <p>I offer to buy one of her sandwiches. She offers to let me use her phone to call the office after lunch. My time with <i>Camion Snack Luminy</i> begins.</p>
      <p>She introduces me to several students eating her food. They are polite enough–indifferent I’d say–but rightfully so. I in no way can keep up with the rate of their lunch gossip. While normal French conversation is maybe twice as fast as I need it be to understand, this was totally out the window. I insert some bulky English sounds to the conversation and ask them about the school. They text me a detailed digital map–much, much better than that useless modern art meets minimalist map I pulled from the train station. One of the students points out some key buildings on the screen and orients me toward Aix–Marseille and les Calanques. I lift my head toward the real things and am impressed at the success of my boldness as I begin to learn my surroundings. Unfortunately, the map has no relevance to my university– Kedge Business School. It stops just where I need it to begin, but it’s the thought that counts here I suppose. I thank them and get down to the business of ordering.</p>
      <p>I scan the menu, flashing back to my French classroom in high school, I open the pages to the unit on ordering food in French. It’s blank.</p>
      <p>Desperately seeking not to disappoint myself, or Martine for that matter, or even Madame Caraballo at Kellam High School, I look for anything on the menu I can fake my way through. Le Royal, S’il vous Plait sloppily falls out of my mouth. The ‘R’ was at the front of my mouth and the ‘L’ created a dumb liaison that was not proper. To boot, an air of uncertainty carried the tail end of my message away in a helium balloon along with all my hopes of sounding competent. Martine grins, confirms, and begins to make what will be my first taste of French food on French turf.</p>
      <p>She and her husband have owned this business and worked together in the truck for 27 years. They recently brought on their nephew, Kevin, after an unfortunate slew of allergies kicked him out of his old occupation. Ah yes, the irony of a baker who can’t touch gluten. If I believed in luck, I would say that it was not on his side and that it also failed in getting me to class today. I spent a good hour with them, enjoyed some mildly underwhelming food, and thoroughly enjoyed the company. We are good for each other and I’m excited to get back to the food truck tomorrow when I’ll be able to pay for the food.</p>

She has given me a part of herself to call my own, she makes me feel safe, and she allows me to recover after I give the day all I have.

      <h2>10. Delta: Water and Numbers</h2>
      <p>Today I walk with purpose. Two days of life through a scavenger’s eyes has caused me to warmly welcome sufficiency back to my side, along with some new friends. I was only able to quickly stop by Camion de Snack to repay my debt to Martine and to pick up a water bottle. I make my way to my last class of the week, which happens to also be the first one I’ve been able to attend. Just outside the classroom, a scattered student mass begins to gather, waiting for the class space to be available. Now is the first time that I’ve had a real chance to observe the smartly dressed and put-together typecast that is the French student body. Ladies and gentlemen, they care about the way they look. No ‘comfy’ clothes for lounging in lecture halls here. Dudes are wearing tight slacks, tees, and the classic euro side-bags, while the women are completely blowing the American girls out of the water. Absolutely beautiful. And even more beautiful is the way they carry themselves. I turn to a relatable street-styled classmate next to me and begin a conversation. She is tall, dark-skinned, and from Canada, so of course I am the one who breaks the French just a couple lines into the conversation. She has an air about her that I wholeheartedly respect. Something like a subdued congeniality that asks me to appreciate the smallest details of her mannerisms. Her smile is honest and tells me that she appreciates our time together. Her name is Cynthia and I appreciated our time together as well.</p>
      <p>I spend the majority of this class with a group of nine fellow students in the back of the classroom. There seems to be an existing friendship between all of the other people in the group. I’m not sure if this is either true, or if the friendly camaraderie I’ve been shown in the days since my arrival to France is expedited without a language barrier. Our time together is productive and I am impressed. From my first impression of the classroom, I expected something very different. There are archetypes you can pick out in any group. For a classroom, these may include the Clown: looking for an audience; Mr. Cool: chilling on the desk; Madam Popular: somehow roping another person into closing the window she in fact just opened moments ago; the list goes on and on. But when the time comes, these differences are discarded in favor of getting the work done. I am comfortable saying that this is the best group I’ve ever worked with. We are able to divide and delegate tasks through simple volunteerism rather than wasting time accusing other members of not stepping up to the plate. This is asset-based community building in a pure and natural situation. It may even be more beautiful than the French women...No. Wow, I take that back. Community is beautiful, but in a different way.</p>
      <p>I made shopping plans with a guy named Enzo from my team. He’s going to show me some of the stores where I can buy things that will help me stop living like a bum. But that’s tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Why is it that I speak better French alone in my room before bed? I keep myself awake at night because I’ve gotten into the nasty habit of running through the day and its situations in my head before sleeping. Except in bed, I can quickly think of the vocabulary I forgot during the day and am myself able to articulate something that resembles a literate response. Whether here or there, should I not be the same regardless of something as trivial as location? And now that this one variable has drastically changed, I ask myself: what value does location actually hold?</p>
      <p>I want so badly to speak like they do. I will eventually.</p>

      <h2>13. A Reflection on the Things Around Us When There is Nothing But Sky</h2>
      <p>I give and I take. I am not selfish. I am certainly not selfless. In the end, however, we are all some combination of both. Understand that merely our presence in a space is a contribution to the whole. Whether we give ourselves to the moment and its potential glory or shy away in recluse is an argument, a conversation, which we can only introspectively conduct. Pacifism is selfish. Excluding oneself from the human existence is denying others the ability to experience you. You, in all of your joys and passions, your mistakes and mediocrities, are worth sharing. Those who seem to have more value do because they’ve committed to themselves the value they hold and continually seek. The only opposition to this worth is esteem: the ambiguous and sly shape-shifter meandering through our veins.</p>
      <p>Selfless and Selfish. So close, yet so different. One is pure, of goodness, of kindness, and of reflective compassion. The other is dark, draining, and abusive. Before we die, we need both. Conversely, an entity that hopes to live cannot be of entirely either. Why then do these hard-fought characteristics change as we enter a religious space? Voices are lowered, the extroverts diverge, and the rest of us gaze in awe. There is a dynamicism in the way a collection of walls also takes on this human dichotomy.  As if living and breathing, I question if the building is passive or active, if it is conscientious and equilibrating. Perhaps not, and is rather something entirely different. As if there isn’t any other choice, there may only be one alternative and this lies in the space between. Regardless of the opinion of sheep, the Church is and always will be at the crux of the exchange between good and evil. She serves not as an institution’s distraction, but as the only way from one to the other.</p>
