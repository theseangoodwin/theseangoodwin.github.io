    <p>A seagull that sounds just like my cat on top of the Frioul archipelago, a new friend whose mannerisms are like Ian’s, a short elderly woman’s silhouette like my Grandmother’s, a laugh from the corner of the room that is just like my mother’s, a sentence that can only come from Aldo’s mind, the bread Kristin vividly described to me, the sunset I’ve dreamt of before, playing music in a circle of friends, the driver of the ambulance turning the corner past Mont De Lans (I swear it was Kez), walking onto a city block that looked like the first French dream I had, Deafheaven from Brent through Ian, Becca, Danny’s blue eyes and bridge piercing, a chessboard, stripping a sheep head, the dead branch I moved into my room, Yohji Yamamoto, Helvetica everywhere, deep purple lipstick, Frnkiero andthe Cellabration, a cocker-spaniel in the park, playing with swans on the water’s edge, the smell of tears, and the taste in your mouth after waking from a nap, Dajung Ha’s criticism, the smell of a bonfire, the sand in my shoes, and treks through a damp forest, ‘thy holy hand grenade’, the bright side of life, deep blue eyes, C minor arpeggio, Brazil, taboo words, the mail office, Wallid, Keha, Kalia, mint tea, the Medina, the rooster and the sunrise, bones, the smell of the tannery and the leather workings, babooshka, Vans, bittersweet friendship, goodbyes, and arrivals.</p>
    <p>These are the things I think I know. They are scattered moments that, in the middle of nowhere, remind me of something familiar and inspired flashbacks to home.</p>

    <h2>20. A Reflection on Language</h2>
    <p>The French language is not some club to be held in an exclusive manner. The perspective that French should only be spoken perfectly may create high barriers for those without fluency who attempt to communicate in the language. I now live in a country where I am not fluent in the dominant language and have to address this confusing mental block in order to survive. I hope others facing similar language hurdles do the same.</p>
    <p>Language may be accessed at many levels, but when I first saw French on a chalkboard I was consistently overwhelmed by the breadth of the language. While I learned it quickly then, I did not feel much passion for it. Here on the bus, I now learn piece by piece how to use the classroom vocabulary that I once wrote on worksheets for a red marker check. Whether it be mere interest or the ordinary pursuit of living well here, I have a rekindled the fire to be good at French. I am not proficient nor do I possess beautiful syntax, but I am getting things done, the most basic purpose of communication. What more could I ask for? Technically nothing, unless I use a translator.</p>

      <h2>21. A Reflection on Myself</h2>
      <p>When I walked into my room last night, I found that all my posters had fallen to the ground. I am so out of my element that even the particles of paint are trying to tell me so. As if I had forgotten that the most basic aspects of my home culture have been taken from me. As if I could forget where I am. Shame on me for trying to make these walls feel a bit more like home. These things around me fall down and so I reach down and re-secure them with care.</p>

      <h3>29.1.15<br>Sanctuary</h3>
      <h2>23. Case</h2>
      <p>This old parish protects me and a few others from the howling winds that wail just outside the creaky wooden doors. My canvas shoes are wet and my hip causes me pain in every step. It is dusk on the third Thursday that I’ve been here in France. The overcast sky and watery streets creep into the church and dampen the walls. Since they cannot force their way in entirely, I imagine this is the most dreary ambiance they can muster. The dominant colors around me are black and blue, which aren’t making me any warmer. The chill and hollow empty space are causing the church to be blustery and cold. I kneel on the smooth rounded bar at my feet and let the discomfort in my bones distract the rest of my body from the cold. I reflect on the days that have passed.</p>
      <p>I began this morning with appointments at LCL Bank and EDF Electricity. Finally some obligations to tend to! I’ve missed the feeling of structure that they give me. My life as a traveler is fine, but I greatly appreciate the feeling of purpose in a daily routine. Crossing the appointments off my list was rewarding. This Saturday, I’m meeting with Enzo and some new friends for the Marseille Evian soccer match. Next weekend I am going to either Grenoble or Milan. Separate groups are traveling to each respective city; we’ll see which one has their act together. I think about the Valentine’s Day weekend trip to Barcelona with several American students who are studying in Paris and Lyon. Birds of a feather do eventually find each other on Facebook and travel together. After these 13 days of freedom from social chains, I admit it is nice to be back amongst humanity.</p>
      <p>My mind is a treacherous place to be. Days and nights are so different and the life I want to lead seems like a distant fantasy. What am I to do if the predisposition I have is the very backbone of my existence? I am like the church. The winds, the cold, the worldly dissonance are all pushing at the doors. I am inside trying my damndest to distract myself from it, kneeling before the altar with the single red candle.</p>

      <h2>24. A Reflection on Odd Numbers</h2>
      <p>What is it about the nature of odd or even that influences our minds? I am told to always design in odd numbers. Yet, sometimes we need something to stick out and at other times we want to blend in, especially now in a new country. The holiness of the number seven is so close to the menace of six yet infinitely more superior. We try our entire lives to bridge the gap of one and many can’t. The love of three parts created a single One, to come onto Earth to demystify the path leading from one to the other. Simplicity, I fear, makes things more difficult. Knowing the odds you’re up against reveals the opposition we face. For someone like myself, that opposition often seems too large to overcome.</p>
      <p>The difference One makes in the scale of eternity is far greater than I ever imagined. The name makes it accessible. Close enough to achieve, but not quite within reach. I continue with the odds in my favor; I’ll take all the help I can get.</p>

      <h3>15:36<br>Mediterranean Sea</h3>
      <h2>25. Les Calanques: Today for Tomorrow</h2>
      <p>I promised myself once I got to the top of the mountain, I would write something. Here I am at 15:36 hidden behind a large jagged rock overlooking the water. The biting wind is painfully chilling the sweat on my back. Four hours on and off the trail got me to this point. I set out without a destination and I can’t imagine ending anywhere else but here.</p>
      <img class="backgroundimage" src="./images/partthree/image12.png" width="200%"/>
      <p>With my camera, a scarf, two oranges, a water bottle, my journal, and a pair of sunglasses packed into my grey JanSport, I started up to the coast. I hiked past Martine’s and the line at her food truck, and then the official at the park reserve offices. There was a vagrant hiker returning from his stroll. My contact with people quickly ended, however, once I hit gravel. The path was completely deserted for these next hours. I hiked and made progress toward the highest peak. I watched the path as it curved around the mountain, barely making progress toward the top. I saw it bend out of view and then return in the other direction 40 feet up the mountainside. This frustrated me. I wanted a straight line, something more direct towards my goal. I kept my heading on the compacted dirt for the sake of consistency. I left the path a few times to explore caves, lookout points, or challenging ascents. I lost my footing on the scraggly limestone gravel and cut my hands on stiff thorny bushes. They continually see me stumble and kick me when I’m down. They leave a tally on my hands for every time I falter.</p>
      <p>Atop one of the rock tables, I noticed a brilliant glimmer coming from the corner of a small exposed rock. I crouched down to inspect it and see some crystalline structure growing from pressure. I assume this is not a stone of any value, but nevertheless I collect some nicely angled pieces in the palm of my hand and hold them. I am pleased to have been rewarded with these pale stones from my side-excursion. I carefully added them to my backpack. I got back up and my footing is abruptly shifted by the coastal wind. I lifted my head and looked further to the side to see that 3 feet away is the edge of the table. I thought about how I could die here.</p>
      <p>The descent is more dangerous than the climb. On the way up, gravity works as an equalizer and slows your pace against the mountain. Coming down, however, gravity works in the same direction as you do, resulting in an ease on your muscles. You accomplish more with less, your focus loosens, and before you know it, gravity pushes your slipping foot down and without a quick reaction, the rest of you will follow. If you aren’t careful, you fall down just when the path seems to get easier. You begin grabbing at anything to get yourself back up, even those damned bushes that cut your palms. Again, I think about how I could die here.</p>
      <p>I continued on the main path and decided that for now, it’s okay to meander up the side of the mountain. It led me to views of Marseille and the Mediterranean Sea that I had never seen before. It gave me a tour of some neighboring cities far off in the distance along with several colorful rock formations jutting out into the water. This path was a challenge. It led me up and down the mountain and I didn’t reach the top until the very end of my trek. I faced a final large white ascent via meandering makeshift-stairs that steeply lead me to the peak. Glancing between my footing and the path in front of me, I was slowed by disorientation. My vision faded in and out as I made slow progress, but refused to stop. I was aware of the danger.</p>
      <p>Filled with adrenaline, I made the final step toward the highest surface. There are no trail markings around me. There are no paths and no people. Looking around, I notice the edge of the cliff with the sea before me. To my right lies a path back towards Luminy, and to the left is Cassis miles away in the distance. I notice a dark stone pillar standing about 6 feet high. I make my way toward the very edge of the rocky cliff to behold the water and the expansive horizon before me. I imagine reaching Africa beyond my side of the water. I am still for a moment. </p>
      <p>I think about the world and begin to imagine myself from above. I see the coast, I see Notre Dame de la Garde, I see Marseille, and I see the Mediterranean countries. I cross the water, then the Atlantic Ocean, and I see Virginia. I am with my family and my friends; I think about how selfish it is for me to be abroad and alone. They need me and I want to be there for them. I am sad to think of what I’m missing, such as the growth, graduations, and happy moments with the ones I know. I am sad to be alone for this moment. For so long, I’ve been an advocate for independence and that being alone doesn’t make you lonely by default. Honestly, I am lonely up here on the cold mountain top, as if the presence of another would make it any warmer.</p>
      <p>I am proud of where I come from and perhaps that is why I miss it. I pick up a hefty rounded rock with two hands and move to the edge. I want to be present for this entire journey; I want to rid myself of these thoughts that weigh me down. I let these negative thoughts leave my body by speaking my frustrations to the stone, listing names and intentions. I moved toe-to-toe with the edge of the cliff and yell as I hurl it as far away from me as I can. I look for my rock but can’t see it once it drops beneath the edge, but the pain in my throat remains.</p>
      <p>I am beyond self-doubt and confliction. I am here and am wholly present. I remind myself that I am 20 years old and living and thriving alone in a new part of the world. These feelings of isolation were expected and aren’t necessarily surprising. I remind myself that my life is changing every day here and that the sacrifices I make to my family are noble, coming from the best intentions. I am not in Marseille to escape the life I lead, but to learn and to be better for it. Down the road, this sacrifice will pay itself back.</p>
      <p>The wind continues to keep me on my toes, correcting my balance as it precisely moves through the threads of my clothes onto my body. I shiver and look up and see the sun peek through the clouds. My throat burns from the strain on my vocal chords. I welcome the pain because it is refreshing amidst the cold of the air pushing down on me. It’s a fire inside my body. I’ve given myself this warmth. I turn and walk in the direction of the stone pillar, deep in thought. My eyes widen and stomach lurches when I realize that my next step will be into the air, off of the cliff. I think about how I could die here.</p>
      <p>I correct my heading and look in the direction of the pillar. There is a metal grating across a recess in the front. I imagine some sort of alcove for a statue in a church. I’m not sure what it is. I stop in front of it to inspect the thick, round structure and find a rope keeping the gate shut. I untie the gate, gently move it open, and see a rope hanging down the middle. I look down into the hole and am confused by the depth of the blackness. The noise of the wind stops. I can feel the sun directly and completely and I retract my head from the stones. I look around and the trees are still. I turn back towards the object in front of me. It’s a well. I’ve never seen one before and stare as if it’s some fantastic thing from a child’s story. I pull on the thin coarse rope until the dented metallic bucket comes up. It echoes as the water falls from its sides. I set the bucket on the sill and look at it, observing its familiarity, smooth sides, and dull metallic marbling. I touch my fingertips into the water and make the sign of the cross on my body to conclude the moment. The wind comes back with vengeance and nudges the bucket on the sill. I catch the rope and lower it back into the hole, close the grating, and turn to walk in the direction of Luminy. The sun is nearly gone and it will only get colder.</p>

She has given me a part of herself to call my own, she makes me feel safe, and she allows me to recover after I give the day all I have.

      <h3>13:04<br>14.1.15<br>Campus</h3>
      <h2>10. Delta: Water and Numbers</h2>
      <p>Today I walk with purpose. Two days of life through a scavenger’s eyes has caused me to warmly welcome sufficiency back to my side, along with some new friends. I was only able to quickly stop by Camion de Snack to repay my debt to Martine and to pick up a water bottle. I make my way to my last class of the week, which happens to also be the first one I’ve been able to attend. Just outside the classroom, a scattered student mass begins to gather, waiting for the class space to be available. Now is the first time that I’ve had a real chance to observe the smartly dressed and put-together typecast that is the French student body. Ladies and gentlemen, they care about the way they look. No ‘comfy’ clothes for lounging in lecture halls here. Dudes are wearing tight slacks, tees, and the classic euro side-bags, while the women are completely blowing the American girls out of the water. Absolutely beautiful. And even more beautiful is the way they carry themselves. I turn to a relatable street-styled classmate next to me and begin a conversation. She is tall, dark-skinned, and from Canada, so of course I am the one who breaks the French just a couple lines into the conversation. She has an air about her that I wholeheartedly respect. Something like a subdued congeniality that asks me to appreciate the smallest details of her mannerisms. Her smile is honest and tells me that she appreciates our time together. Her name is Cynthia and I appreciated our time together as well.</p>
      <p>I spend the majority of this class with a group of nine fellow students in the back of the classroom. There seems to be an existing friendship between all of the other people in the group. I’m not sure if this is either true, or if the friendly camaraderie I’ve been shown in the days since my arrival to France is expedited without a language barrier. Our time together is productive and I am impressed. From my first impression of the classroom, I expected something very different. There are archetypes you can pick out in any group. For a classroom, these may include the Clown: looking for an audience; Mr. Cool: chilling on the desk; Madam Popular: somehow roping another person into closing the window she in fact just opened moments ago; the list goes on and on. But when the time comes, these differences are discarded in favor of getting the work done. I am comfortable saying that this is the best group I’ve ever worked with. We are able to divide and delegate tasks through simple volunteerism rather than wasting time accusing other members of not stepping up to the plate. This is asset-based community building in a pure and natural situation. It may even be more beautiful than the French women...No. Wow, I take that back. Community is beautiful, but in a different way.</p>
      <p>I made shopping plans with a guy named Enzo from my team. He’s going to show me some of the stores where I can buy things that will help me stop living like a bum. But that’s tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Why is it that I speak better French alone in my room before bed? I keep myself awake at night because I’ve gotten into the nasty habit of running through the day and its situations in my head before sleeping. Except in bed, I can quickly think of the vocabulary I forgot during the day and am myself able to articulate something that resembles a literate response. Whether here or there, should I not be the same regardless of something as trivial as location? And now that this one variable has drastically changed, I ask myself: what value does location actually hold?</p>

      <h2>13. A Reflection on the Things Around Us When There is Nothing But Sky</h2>
      <p>I give and I take. I am not selfish. I am certainly not selfless. In the end, however, we are all some combination of both. Understand that merely our presence in a space is a contribution to the whole. Whether we give ourselves to the moment and its potential glory or shy away in recluse is an argument, a conversation, which we can only introspectively conduct. Pacifism is selfish. Excluding oneself from the human existence is denying others the ability to experience you. You, in all of your joys and passions, your mistakes and mediocrities, are worth sharing. Those who seem to have more value do because they’ve committed to themselves the value they hold and continually seek. The only opposition to this worth is esteem: the ambiguous and sly shape-shifter meandering through our veins.</p>
      <p>Selfless and Selfish. So close, yet so different. One is pure, of goodness, of kindness, and of reflective compassion. The other is dark, draining, and abusive. Before we die, we need both. Conversely, an entity that hopes to live cannot be of entirely either. Why then do these hard-fought characteristics change as we enter a religious space? Voices are lowered, the extroverts diverge, and the rest of us gaze in awe. There is a dynamicism in the way a collection of walls also takes on this human dichotomy.  As if living and breathing, I question if the building is passive or active, if it is conscientious and equilibrating. Perhaps not, and is rather something entirely different. As if there isn’t any other choice, there may only be one alternative and this lies in the space between. Regardless of the opinion of sheep, the Church is and always will be at the crux of the exchange between good and evil. She serves not as an institution’s distraction, but as the only way from one to the other.</p>
